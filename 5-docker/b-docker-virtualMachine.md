DOCKER VS VIRTUAL MACHINE

Docker only contains the application layer, it uses the OS kernel and hardware of the host machine. Check if host can run docker natively, else you will use tech called docker Toolbox
    -- The size is smaller
    -- It is faster than VM
    -- It is compatible with any OS host

Virtual machine contains the application and OS Kernel layers and uses the hardware of the host machine.
